Headless authentication server for securing your apps, inspired by Netlify GoTrue, but built with [Deno](https://deno.land/).

[GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue) is a JWT based API for managing users and issuing JWT tokens from Netlify.

## Quick Start

### Database Connection

```plain
Postgres  : postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/fastrue?sslmode=disable
Cockroach : postgres://root@127.0.0.1:26257/fastrue?sslmode=disable
```

### Database Tasks
```sh
deno task db:make-migration create_users
deno task db:make-seeder default_users

deno task db:status
deno task db:migrate
deno task db:rollback
deno task db:reset
```

### Run the app

```sh
deno task run          # Start with host timezine
TZ=UTC deno task run   # Start with UTC timezone
```

Open <http://localhost:9999> to view it in the browser.

### Compile binary

```sh
deno task compile
```


### Test with curl

```sh
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer secret' http://localhost:9999/token
```
